\usage{
QCreport(
  df,
  out.dir = dirname(df$filepath[1]),
  plot.ext = ".pdf",
  create.ofst = TRUE,
  BPPARAM = bpparam()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{an ORFik \code{\link{experiment}}}

\item{out.dir}{optional output directory, default:
\code{dirname(df$filepath[1])}.
Will make a folder called "QC_STATS" with all results in this directory.
Warning: If you assign not default path, you will have a hazzle to load files later.
Much easier to load count tables, statistics, ++ later with default.}

\item{plot.ext}{character, default: ".pdf". Alternatives: ".png" or ".jpg".
Note that in pdf format the complex correlation plots become very slow to load!}

\item{create.ofst}{logical, default TRUE. Create ".ofst" files from the input
libraries, ofst is much faster to load in R, for later use. Stored
in ./ofst/ folder relative to experiment main folder.}

\item{BPPARAM}{how many cores/threads to use? default: bpparam().
To see number of threads used, do \code{bpparam()$workers}.
You can also add a time remaining bar, for a more detailed pipeline.}

\description{
The ORFik QC uses the aligned files (usually bam files),
fastp and STAR log files
combined with annotation to create relevant statistics.\cr\cr
This report consists of several steps:\cr
1. Convert bam file / Input files to ".ofst" format, if not already done.
This format is around 400x faster to use in R than the bam format.
Files are also outputted to R environment specified by \code{envExp(df)}\cr
2. From this report you will get a summary csv table, with distribution of
aligned reads and overlap counts over transcript regions like:
leader, cds, trailer, lincRNAs, tRNAs, rRNAs, snoRNAs etc. It will be called
STATS.csv. And can be imported with \code{\link{QCstats}} function.\cr
3. It will also make correlation plots and meta coverage plots,
so you get a good understanding of how good the quality of your NGS
data production + aligner step were.\cr
4. Count tables are produced, similar to HTseq count tables.
Over mrna, leader, cds and trailer separately. This tables
are stored as \code{\link{SummarizedExperiment}}, for easy loading into
DEseq, conversion to normalized fpkm values,
or collapsing replicates in an experiment.
And can be imported with \code{\link{countTable}} function.\cr\cr
Everything will be outputed in the directory of your NGS data,
inside the folder ./QC_STATS/, relative to data location in 'df'.
You can specify new out location with out.dir if you want.\cr
