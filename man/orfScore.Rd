\title{Get ORFscore for a GRangesList of ORFs}
\usage{
orfScore(
  grl,
  RFP,
  is.sorted = FALSE,
  weight = "score",
  overlapGrl = NULL,
  coverage = NULL,
  stop3 = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{grl}{a \code{\link{GRangesList}} of 5' utrs, CDS, transcripts, etc.}

\item{RFP}{ribosomal footprints, given as \code{\link{GAlignments}}
or \code{\link{GRanges}} object,
must be already shifted and resized to the p-site. Requires a $size column
with original read lengths.}

\item{is.sorted}{logical (FALSE), is grl sorted. That is + strand groups in
increasing ranges (1,2,3), and - strand groups in decreasing ranges (3,2,1)}

\item{weight}{(default: 'score'), if defined a character name
of valid meta column in subject. GRanges("chr1", 1, "+", score = 5),
would mean score column tells that this alignment region was found 5 times.
ORFik ofst, bedoc and .bedo files contains a score column like this.
As do CAGEr CAGE files and many other package formats.
You can also assign a score column manually.}

\item{overlapGrl}{an integer, (default: NULL),
if defined must be countOverlaps(grl, RFP),
added for speed if you already have it}

\item{coverage}{a data.table from coveragePerTiling of length same as 'grl' argument.
Save time if you have already computed it.}

\item{stop3}{logical, default TRUE. Stop if any input is of width < 3.}
}
\value{
a data.table with 4 columns, the orfscore (ORFScores) and score of
each of the 3 tiles (frame_zero_RP, frame_one_RP, frame_two_RP)
}
\description{
ORFscore tries to check whether the first frame of the 3 possible frames in
an ORF has more reads than second and third frame. IMPORTANT: Only use
p-shifted libraries, see (\code{\link{detectRibosomeShifts}}).
Else this score makes no sense.
}
\details{
Pseudocode:
assume rff - is reads fraction in specific frame
\preformatted{ORFScore = log(rff1 + rff2 + rff3)}
If rff2 or rff3 is bigger than rff1,
negate the resulting value.
\preformatted{ORFScore[rff1Smaller] <- ORFScore[rff1Smaller] * -1}

As result there is one value per ORF:
- Positive values say that the first frame have the most reads,
- zero values means it is uniform:
(ORFscore between -2.5 and 2.5 can be considered close to uniform),
- negative values say that the first frame does not have the most reads.
NOTE non-pshifted reads:
If reads are not of width 1, then a read from 1-4 on range of 1-4,
will get scores frame1 = 2, frame2 = 1, frame3 = 1. What could be logical
is that only the 5' end is important, so that only frame1 = 1,
to get this, you first resize reads to 5'end only.

General NOTES:
1. p shifting is not exact, so some functional ORFs will get a
bad ORF score. \cr
2. If a score column is defined, it will use it as weights, set
to weight = 1L if you don't have weight, and score column is
something else.
3. If needed a test for significance and critical values,
use chi-squared. There are 3 degrees of freedom (3 frames),
so critical 0.05 (3-1 degrees of freedm = 2), value is: log2(6) = 2.58

\examples{
ORF <- GRanges(seqnames = "1",
               ranges = IRanges(start = c(1, 10, 20), end = c(5, 15, 25)),
               strand = "+")
names(ORF) <- c("tx1", "tx1", "tx1")
grl <- GRangesList(tx1_1 = ORF)
RFP <- GRanges("1", IRanges(25, 25), "+") # 1 width position based
score(RFP) <- 28 # original width
orfScore(grl, RFP) # negative because more hits on frames 1,2 than 0.

# example with positive result, more hits on frame 0 (in frame of ORF)
RFP <- GRanges("1", IRanges(c(1, 1, 1, 25), width = 1), "+")
score(RFP) <- c(28, 29, 31, 28) # original width
orfScore(grl, RFP)
