\title{Map genomic to transcript coordinates by reference}
\usage{
asTX(
  grl,
  reference,
  ignore.strand = FALSE,
  x.is.sorted = TRUE,
  tx.is.sorted = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{grl}{a \code{\link{GRangesList}} of ranges within
the reference, grl must have column called names that gives
grouping for result}

\item{reference}{a GrangesList of ranges that include and are bigger or
equal to grl ig. cds is grl and gene can be reference}

\item{ignore.strand}{When ignore.strand is TRUE, strand is ignored in
overlaps operations (i.e., all strands are considered "+") and the
strand in the output is '*'. \cr
When ignore.strand is FALSE (default) strand in the output is taken from the
transcripts argument. When transcripts is a GRangesList, all inner list
elements of a common list element must have the same strand
or an error is thrown. \cr
Mapped position is computed by counting from the transcription start site
 (TSS) and is not affected by the value of ignore.strand.}

\item{x.is.sorted}{if x is a GRangesList object, are "-" strand groups pre-sorted
in decreasing order within group, default: TRUE}

\item{tx.is.sorted}{if transcripts is a GRangesList object,
are "-" strand groups pre-sorted in decreasing order within group,
default: TRUE}
}
\value{
a GRangesList in transcript coordinates
}
\description{
Map range coordinates between features in the genome and
transcriptome (reference) space.
}
\details{
Similar to GenomicFeatures' pmapToTranscripts, but in this version the
grl ranges are compared to reference ranges with same name, not
by index. And it has a security fix.
