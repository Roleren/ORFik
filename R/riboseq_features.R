#' Create normalizations of overlapping read counts.
#'
#' FPKM is short for "Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million
#' fragments in library". When calculating RiboSeq data FPKM over ORFs,
#' use ORFs as `grl`.
#' When calculating RNASeq data FPKM, use full transcripts as
#' `grl`. It is equal to RPKM given that you do not have paired end reads.
#'
#' Note also that you must consider if you will use the whole read
#' library or just the reads overlapping `grl` for library size.
#' A normal question here is, does it make sense to include rRNA in library
#' size ?
#' If you only want overlapping grl, do:
#' librarySize = "overlapping"
#' @references doi: 10.1038/nbt.1621
#' @param grl a \code{\link{GRangesList}} object
#'  can be either transcripts, 5' utrs, cds', 3' utrs or
#'  ORFs as a special case (uORFs, potential new cds' etc). If
#'  regions are not spliced you can send a \code{\link{GRanges}} object.
#' @param reads a \code{\link{GAlignments}}, \code{\link{GRanges}} or
#' \code{\link{GRangesList}} object, usually of RiboSeq, RnaSeq, CageSeq, etc.
#' @param pseudoCount an integer, by default is 0, set it to 1 if you want to
#' avoid NA and inf values.
#' @param librarySize either numeric value or character vector.
#' Default ("full"), number of alignments in library (reads).
#' If you just have a subset, you can give the value by
#' librarySize = length(wholeLib),
#' if you want lib size to be only number of reads overlapping grl, do:
#' librarySize = "overlapping"
#' sum(countOverlaps(reads, grl) > 0),
#' if reads[1] has 3 hits in grl, and reads[2] has 2 hits,
#' librarySize will be 2, not 5.
#' You can also get the inverse overlap,
#' if you want lib size to be total number of overlaps, do:
#' librarySize = "DESeq"
#' This is standard fpkm way of DESeq2::fpkm(robust = FALSE)
#' sum(countOverlaps(grl, reads))
#' if grl[1] has 3 reads and grl[2] has 2 reads, librarySize is 5, not 2.

#' Fragment Length Organization Similarity Score
#'
#' This feature is usually calcualted only for RiboSeq reads. For reads of
#' width between `start` and `end`,
#' sum the fraction of RiboSeq reads (per read widths)
#' that overlap ORFs and normalize by CDS read width fractions.
#' So if all read length are width 34 in ORFs and CDS, value is 1.
#' If width is 33 in ORFs and 34 in CDS, value is 0.
#' If width is 33 in ORFs and 50/50 (33 and 34) in CDS, values will be
#' 0.5 (for 33).

#' Get ORFscore for a GRangesList of ORFs
#'
#' ORFscore tries to check whether the first frame of the 3 possible frames in
#' an ORF has more reads than second and third frame. IMPORTANT: Only use
#' p-shifted libraries, see (\code{\link{detectRibosomeShifts}}).
#' Else this score makes no sense.
#'
#' Pseudocode:
#' assume rff - is reads fraction in specific frame
#' \preformatted{ORFScore = log(rff1 + rff2 + rff3)}
#' If rff2 or rff3 is bigger than rff1,
#' negate the resulting value.
#' \preformatted{ORFScore[rff1Smaller] <- ORFScore[rff1Smaller] * -1}
#'
#' As result there is one value per ORF:
#' - Positive values say that the first frame have the most reads,
#' - zero values means it is uniform:
#' (ORFscore between -2.5 and 2.5 can be considered close to uniform),
#' - negative values say that the first frame does not have the most reads.
#' NOTE non-pshifted reads:
#' If reads are not of width 1, then a read from 1-4 on range of 1-4,
#' will get scores frame1 = 2, frame2 = 1, frame3 = 1. What could be logical
#' is that only the 5' end is important, so that only frame1 = 1,
#' to get this, you first resize reads to 5'end only.
#'
#' General NOTES:
#' 1. p shifting is not exact, so some functional ORFs will get a
#' bad ORF score. \cr
#' 2. If a score column is defined, it will use it as weights, set
#' to weight = 1L if you don't have weight, and score column is
#' something else.
#' 3. If needed a test for significance and critical values,
#' use chi-squared. There are 3 degrees of freedom (3 frames),
#' so critical 0.05 (3-1 degrees of freedm = 2), value is: log2(6) = 2.58
