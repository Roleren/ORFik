#' Find peaks per gene
#'
#' For finding the peaks (stall sites) per gene, with some default filters.
#' A peak is basically a position of very high coverage compared to
#' its surrounding area, as measured using zscore.
#'
#' The 'reads' argument should be 1 width reads like p-shifts,
#' or other reads that is single positioned. It will work with non 1 width bases,
#' but you then get larger areas for peaks.
#'
#' For more details see reference, which uses a slightly different method by zscore
#' of a sliding window instead of over the whole tx.
#' @inheritParams filterExtremePeakGenes
#' @param top_tx numeric, default 0.50 (only use 50\% top transcripts by
#' read counts).
#' @param min_reads_per_tx numeric, default 20. Gene must have at least
#'  20 reads, applied before type filter.
#' @param min_reads_per_peak numeric, default 10. Peak must have at
#'  least 10 reads.
#' @param type character, default "max". Get only max peak per gene.
#' Alternatives: "all", all peaks passing the input filter will be returned.
#' "median", only peaks that is higher than the median of all peaks. "maxmedian":
#' get first "max", then median of those.
#' @param gene_ids character vector, names of genes, default names(tx)
#' @param coverage a data.table of coverage, with columns position, score and genes
#' @return a data.table of gene_id, position, counts of the peak, zscore
#' and standard deviation of the peak compared to rest of gene area.
