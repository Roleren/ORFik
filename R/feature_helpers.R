#' CountOverlaps with weights
#'
#' Similar to countOverlaps, but takes an optional weight column.
#' This is usually the score column
#'
#' @param query IRanges, IRangesList, GRanges, GRangesList object.
#' Usually transcript a transcript region.
#' @param subject GRanges, GRangesList, GAlignment, usually reads.
#' @param weight (default: NULL), if defined either numeric or character name
#' of valid meta column in subject. If weight is single numeric, it is used
#' for all. A normall weight is the score column given as weight = "score".
#' GRanges("chr1", 1, "+", score = 5), would mean score column tells
#' that this alignment region was found 5 times.
#' @param ... additional arguments passed to countOverlaps/findOverlaps
#' @return a named vector of number of overlaps to subject weigthed
#'  by 'weight' column.
